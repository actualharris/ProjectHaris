Note to Self: This version of the code is for deployment on GitHub Pages only. On the development system, switch to the gh-pages branch and merge gh-pages-code into it. Then, build and deploy directly. The changes will reflect on the gh-pages branch on GitHub. 
NOTE: Deployment is done from the gh-pages branch in the sense that, it gets auto deployed when run "npm run deploy" from gh-pages branch in local system. No need to push any changes from local system to remote origin for this gh-pages branch.
