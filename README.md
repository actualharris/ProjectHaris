My portfolio website showcasing my work.

Note to Self: This is the development version of the website’s code. This version is merged with the main branch periodically. For GitHub hosting, switch to gh-pages-code.
NOTE: When merging files from main to gh-pages-code, make sure to resolve merge conflicts because vite.config.js, AppRoutes.jsx, README.md, have different code for the purpose of hosting and not run on local dev environment
